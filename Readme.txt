Hi,
I've recently rewritten the entire project using Classes so its all object orientated.

Comic_Slider_OO.py
This is the main entry where you run:

python Comic_Slider_OO.py --filename "somecomic.cbz" --sourcefolder "somefolder" --outputfolder "somefolder"

There are 3 test.bat files testing each combination.

Comic_Slider_Utils_OO.py
Is mostly file management.

Comic_Slider_Image_OO.py
Image and PPTX slide generation

Comic_Slider_Logger_OO.py
I'd like a better way, or to know the standard way of using Logger objects

To launch
python Comic_Slider_OO.py --filename "somecomic.cbz" --sourcefolder "somefolder" --outputfolder "somefolder"
